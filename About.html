<h1>About us</h1>
<p> We are the Four Consecutive Pucks teams. The goal of our project is to create an interactive Connect 4 game. It can be played by a user
against the computer. The game is played on a rectangular game board consisting of seven
columns, each with six empty slots. Each user has coloured pieces (one user will be red, the
other yellow) they he/she can drop into the empty slots from the top of each column. The
object of the game is to end up with four consecutive pucks, either horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally, before your opponent. Things to remember are that pucks can only be
dropped into slots from the top of the columns, and that you must always watch out for your
opponent's moves.</p>

<p> The Project  was break down goes as follows<br>
Duties<br>
Pat Behrens -Game Logic<br>
Katie Kalm - Board Graphics<br>
Joseph Demma - HTML site and help</p>

<p>Game Logic -This is the foundation of the game itself and will consist of all the rules and logic
needed in order for the user to have an interactive experience. Game logic will be the basis for the
application and will contain all the needed control code instructions that the user of the game will
abide by. Furthermore, it will control how the computer responds to the user's moves.</p>

<p>HTML Site/Interface -The actual interface design will serve as the front end of the game and the
user will be able to click on buttons or screen objects in order to communicate with the game logic.
The design of the HTML site will need to be performed in a way that it works hand in hand with the
game logic piece.</p>

<p>Board Graphics -The display set and graphics colorset used along with any animation features will
be tackled in this arena.</p>

<p> We used the following languages in our project:<br>
Javascript<br>
HTML<br>
CSS</p>
